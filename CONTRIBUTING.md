## 🎨 Design Principles

Sales Expert follows a specific aesthetic:
- **Primary Colors**: Black (`#000000`) and Gold (`#FFC107`).
- **Typography**: Tracking should be tight (`tracking-tight`) for headings and wide (`tracking-widest`) for uppercase labels.
- **Components**: UI should feel "Premium" and "Glassmorphic" (use `bg-white/5` with `border-white/5`).

## 🛠 Development Process

1. **Setup**: Follow the installation steps in the [README.md](./README.md).
2. **Branching**: Use descriptive branch names like `fix/auth-crash` or `feat/dark-mode-toggle`.
3. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` before committing.
